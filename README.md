# NeuroCal

Modern React + Tailwind prototype for an AI-assisted calendar experience.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build

The dev server prints a local URL you can open in any browser. Hot reload is enabled out of the box via Vite.
